This repository is for the project done in Purdue IEEE CSociety Fall 2018 where we do hand gesture recognition. This Pytorch model is capable of learning a new user-input gesture with one shot inspired by the [repo](https://github.com/normandipalo/faceID_beta/blob/master/). However, the model from keras with Python can do very accurate hand gesture recognition with no ability to do one-shot learning yet
